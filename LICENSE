 TERMS:

Any objectionable material found on, or found elsewhere, the origin of which, can be traced to having a direct/indirect relation to or inspiration from this project and its affiliates is unintended and should be attributed to the complex nature of internet data.

The use of such words, or any reference to such words, or anything that can be construed as abusive/demeaning/racist/vulgar/insensitive/offensive – language - vocal/symbolic/abstract/figurative/graphical/anything that stands as a language/script/mode of communication - in any manner whatsoever, even innuendo, is colloquial, and should be understood as being rudimentary part of speech. Any information or rule within the project is subject to change without notice and I assume no duty to notify you of the changes. Any opinion, interpretation, estimate (with regards technological, financial, regulatory and other areas of domain expertise, and including but not limited to information based upon or provided by third parties) provided constitute my judgement and should be regarded as indicative, preliminary and for illustrative purposes only.

However, you agree to absolve me off any arraigns for any misdemeanor by any; the onus of tracking compliance to your notice while any uses an item, the ownership/lease of which lies upon you, rests on you. Moreover, in return of using this project within the gambit of open source, you agree to not press any claims for use of your items as long as the use of said items are used as is and are used within the confines of workings of the project, which might imply exposing the project to other third party tools for the project to reach a working condition. In case you are going to discuss about a topic bonded by legal rules and regulations to which you are a subject of or having relation to, you agree to have put the respective license/agreement/notice/any document/image/object/idea and permission to use the said topic with related functionality in a place that can be accessed publicly.

 LEGAL:

This project is intended to be general information and does not provide investment advice in any capacity. In no circumstances, should an information/document/advice/conversation/event be construed as regulatory, valuation, legal, tax, accounting or investment advice and it does not constitute a recommendation, solicitation offer or commitment to purchase, sell or underwrite any to you, from you, or on your behalf, or to extend any credit or provide any insurance to you or to enter into any transaction unless expressly constituted. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, I am not acting as your financial advisor or fiduciary. Before you enter into any transaction, you should ensure that you fully understand the potential risks and rewards of that transaction and you should consult with such advisors, as you deem necessary, to assist you in making these determinations including but not limited to your accountants, investment advisors, legal and/or tax experts. I shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, consequences, incurred by you or any third party that may arise from any relevance with relation to the project and its affiliates. I do not owe any obligation derived/deduced unto-with but not limited to any leading to claims or consequences due to association (or lack thereof) to this project and its affiliates. You agree to be associated to this project or its affiliates at your own accord. The hosting providers (Google, GoDaddy) that provide access to our online content are just hosting providers. They have absolute immunity from consequences and cannot be made party to any claim whatsoever. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Having associated with any part/as a whole of this project and/or its affiliates, it is implicitly understood by all concerned parties that you agree to all the notes, as mentioned.

You renounce your right to litigation in the courts of Law of such Land in case of claims or disputes arising out of your relations to and/or dealings with any inside/outside the project and its affiliates, notwithstanding of you, being or not being a subject to Laws of such Land. All claims and/or disputes arising out of relating to these terms or the services provided by, or lack thereof, and/or activities of the project and its affiliates will be litigated exclusively in the HIGH COURT OF JHARKHAND, RANCHI, INDIA, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. I reserve the right to delegate all these rights to any indefinite number of times without any obligation or notification.
